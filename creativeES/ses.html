<h1> Supportive Employment Services
</h1>
<h2> What is Supportive Employment? </h2>
<p>Creative Employment Services is a Supported Work Program whose aim is finding competitive work in a 
community-integrated work setting for persons with disabilities who need ongoing support services to learn 
and perform the work. CESâ€™s placements can be individual placements, or group placements (called enclaves), 
or work crews, such as landscaping crews. A job specialist who meets regularly with the individual on the job 
to help him or her learn the necessary skills and behaviors to work independently usually provides support. 
As the individual gains mastery of the job, the 
support services will phase out or remain in place. </p>
